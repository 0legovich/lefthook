# Basic usage:
#
# pre-commit:                                   # add hook group through "hookah add pre-commit"
#                                               # or "npx hookah add pre-commit" if you install hookah as npm package
#
#  commands:                                    # keyword for list of commands
#    eslint:                                    # command name, you will see it in output
#      glob: "*.{js,ts}"                        # glob filter
#      runner: yarn eslint {staged_files}       # list of staged files which will be filtred through glob filter
#    rubocop:
#      glob: "*.{rb}"
#      exclude: "application.rb|routes.rb"      # simple regexp for more flexibility
#      runner: bundle exec rubocop {all_files}
